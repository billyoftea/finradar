      "text": "This is a political attack\n\nGlobal Government Affairs (@GlobalAffairs)\n\nFrench judicial authorities raided X’s Paris office today in connection with a politicized criminal investigation into alleged manipulation of algorithms and purported fraudulent data extraction. We are disappointed by this development, but we are not surprised. The Paris Public Prosecutor’s office widely publicized the raid—making clear that today’s action was an abusive act of law enforcement theater designed to achieve illegitimate political objectives rather than advance legitimate law enforcement goals rooted in the fair and impartial administration of justice.\n\nThe Paris Public Prosecutor's Office is plainly attempting to exert pressure on X’s senior management in the United States by targeting our French entity and employees, who are not the focus of this investigation. The Prosecutor’s Office has ignored the established procedural mechanisms to obtain evidence in compliance with international treaties and X’s rights to defend itself. These procedural mechanisms are well known and used on a daily basis by judicial authorities around the world.\n\nThe allegations underlying today’s raid are baseless and X categorically denies any wrongdoing. Today’s staged raid reinforces our conviction that this investigation distorts French law, circumvents due process, and endangers free speech. X is committed to defending its fundamental rights and the rights of its users.  We will not be intimidated by the actions of French judicial authorities today. \n\n___________________\n\nLes autorités judiciaires françaises ont perquisitionné ce jour les bureaux parisiens de X dans le cadre d'une enquête pénale reposant sur des motivations politiques et faisant suite à des allégations de manipulation d'algorithmes et de prétendues extractions frauduleuses de données. Nous sommes déçus par ce développement mais il ne nous surprend pas. Le parquet de Paris a donné un large écho médiatique à cette mesure, démontrant ainsi qu’elle constitue un acte judiciaire abusif visant à atteindre des objectifs politiques illégitimes plutôt qu’à favoriser la plus juste application de la loi dans le respect d’une administration loyale et impartiale de la justice.\n\nLe parquet de Paris tente manifestement d’exercer une pression sur la direction générale de X aux Etats-Unis en visant notre entité française, étrangère aux faits poursuivis, ainsi que ses employés, au mépris des mécanismes procéduraux établis par les traités internationaux leur permettant de collecter des preuves ainsi que du droit de X de se défendre. Ces mécanismes et véhicules procéduraux sont parfaitement connus et utilisés quotidiennement par les autorités judiciaires du monde entier.\n\nLes allégations ayant justifié cette perquisition sont infondées et X réfute catégoriquement avoir commis la moindre infraction. Cette mise en scène ne fait que renforcer sa conviction que cette enquête viole le droit français, constitue un détournement de procédure et porte atteinte à la liberté d'expression. X est déterminée à défendre ses droits fondamentaux ainsi que ceux de ses utilisateurs.  Nous ne nous laisserons pas intimider par les mesures mises en œuvre aujourd'hui par les autorités judiciaires françaises.\n\n— http://localhost/GlobalAffairs/status/2018773488602095916#m",

      "text": "There have recently been some discussions on the ongoing role of L2s in the Ethereum ecosystem, especially in the face of two facts:\n\n* L2s' progress to stage 2 (and, secondarily, on interop) has been far slower and more difficult than originally expected\n\n* L1 itself is scaling, fees are very low, and gaslimits are projected to increase greatly in 2026\n\nBoth of these facts, for their own separate reasons, mean that the original vision of L2s and their role in Ethereum no longer makes sense, and we need a new path.\n\nFirst, let us recap the original vision. Ethereum needs to scale. The definition of \"Ethereum scaling\" is the existence of large quantities of block space that is backed by the full faith and credit of Ethereum - that is, block space where, if you do things (including with ETH) inside that block space, your activities are guaranteed to be valid, uncensored, unreverted, untouched, as long as Ethereum itself functions. If you create a 10000 TPS EVM where its connection to L1 is mediated by a multisig bridge, then you are not scaling Ethereum.\n\nThis vision no longer makes sense. L1 does not need L2s to be \"branded shards\", because L1 is itself scaling. And L2s are not able or willing to satisfy the properties that a true \"branded shard\" would require. I've even seen at least one explicitly saying that they may never want to go beyond stage 1, not just for technical reasons around ZK-EVM safety, but also because their customers' regulatory needs require them to have ultimate control. This may be doing the right thing for your customers. But it should be obvious that if you are doing this, then you are not \"scaling Ethereum\" in the sense meant by the rollup-centric roadmap. But that's fine! it's fine because Ethereum itself is now scaling directly on L1, with large planned increases to its gas limit this year and the years ahead.\n\nWe should stop thinking about L2s as literally being \"branded shards\" of Ethereum, with the social status and responsibilities that this entails. Instead, we can think of L2s as being a full spectrum, which includes both chains backed by the full faith and credit of Ethereum with various unique properties (eg. not just EVM), as well as a whole array of options at different levels of connection to Ethereum, that each person (or bot) is free to care about or not care about depending on their needs.\n\nWhat would I do today if I were an L2?\n\n* Identify a value add other than \"scaling\". Examples: (i) non-EVM specialized features/VMs around privacy, (ii) efficiency specialized around a particular application, (iii) truly extreme levels of scaling that even a greatly expanded L1 will not do, (iv) a totally different design for non-financial applications, eg. social, identity, AI, (v) ultra-low-latency and other sequencing properties, (vi) maybe built-in oracles or decentralized dispute resolution or other \"non-computationally-verifiable\" features\n\n* Be stage 1 at the minimum (otherwise you really are just a separate L1 with a bridge, and you should just call yourself that) if you're doing things with ETH or other ethereum-issued assets\n\n* Support maximum interoperability with Ethereum, though this will differ for each one (eg. what if you're not EVM, or even not financial?)\n\nFrom Ethereum's side, over the past few months I've become more convinced of the value of the native rollup precompile, particuarly once we have enshrined ZK-EVM proofs that we need anyway to scale L1. This is a precompile that verifies a ZK-EVM proof, and it's \"part of Ethereum\", so (i) it auto-upgrades along with Ethereum, and (ii) if the precompile has a bug, Ethereum will hard-fork to fix the bug.\n\nThe native rollup precompile would make full, security-council-free, EVM verification accessible. We should spend much more time working out how to design it in such a way that if your L2 is \"EVM plus other stuff\", then the native rollup precompile would verify the EVM, and you only have to bring your own prover for the \"other stuff\" (eg. Stylus). This might involve a canonical way of exposing a lookup table between contract call inputs and outputs, and letting you provide your own values to the lookup table (that you would prove separately).\n\nThis would make it easy to have safe, strong, trustless interoperability with Ethereum. It also enables synchronous composability (see: https://ethresear.ch/t/combining-preconfirmations-with-based-rollups-for-synchronous-composability/23863 and https://ethresear.ch/t/synchronous-composability-between-rollups-via-realtime-proving/23998 ). And from there, it's each L2's choice exactly what they want to build. Don't just \"extend L1\", figure out something new to add.\n\nThis of course means that some will add things that are trust-dependent, or backdoored, or otherwise insecure; this is unavoidable in a permissionless ecosystem where developers have freedom. Our job should make to make it clear to users what guarantees they have, and to build up the strongest Ethereum that we can.",

The world needs orders of magnitude more compute.\n\nThat’s why we are anchoring on NVIDIA as the core of our training and inference stack, while deliberately expanding the ecosystem around it through partnerships with Cerebras, AMD and Broadcom. This approach lets us move faster, deploy more broadly, and support the explosion of real-world use cases without sacrificing performance or reliability. The outcome is simple and durable: infrastructure that can carry frontier capability all the way into production, at global scale.",

Votes here should be anonymous, ideally MACI'd to reduce risk of collusion.\n\nThe prediction market is the correct way to do a \"decentralized executive\", because the most logical primitive for \"accountability\" in a permissionless concept is exactly that.\n\nThough sometimes you will want to keep it simple, and do a centralized executive at that layer instead:\n\n[replaceable centralized executive] -> [something that looks like a capture-resistant, non-financialized preference-setting gadget]\n\nThinking in these two layers explicitly: (i) what is doing your execution, (ii) what is doing your preference-setting and is judging the executor(s), is best.\n\nMilliΞ (@llamaonthebrink)\n\nYesterday Vitalik posted about a curation-style creator platform idea, and while it seems like a complicated solution, his idea will likely prove directionally correct in the not so distant future.\n\nEvery major social media platform optimizes for popularity contests over quality content creation.\n\nThere has to be an opportunity in an alternative approach.\n\n— http://localhost/llamaonthebrink/status/2018205196568944653#m",

      "text": "How I would do creator coins\n\nWe've seen about 10 years of people trying to do content incentivization in crypto, from early-stage platforms like Bihu and Steemit, to BitClout in 2021, to Zora, to tipping features inside of decentralized social, and more. So far, I think we have not been very successful, and I think this is because the problem is fundamentally hard.\n\nFirst, my view of what the problem is. A major difference between doing \"creator incentives\" in the 00s vs doing them today, is that in the 00s, a primary problem was having not enough content at all. In the 20s, there's plenty of content, AI can generate an entire metaverse full of it for like $10. The problem is quality. And so your goal is not *incentivizing content*, it's *surfacing good content*.\n\nPersonally, I think that the most successful example of creator incentives we've seen is Substack. To see why, take a look at the top 10:\n\nhttps://substack.com/leaderboard/technology/paid\n\nhttps://substack.com/leaderboard/culture/paid\n\nhttps://substack.com/leaderboard/world-politics/paid\n\nNow, you may disagree with many of these authors. But I have no doubt that:\n\n1. They are on the whole high quality, and contribute positively to the discussion\n\n2. They are mostly people who would not have been elevated without Substack's presence\n\nSo Substack is genuinely surfacing high quality and pluralism.\n\nNow, we can compare to creator coin projects. I don't want to pick on a single one, because I think there's a failure mode of the entire category.\n\nFor example:\n\nTop Zora creator coins: https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/zora-creator-coins\n\nBitClout: https://www.businessofbusiness.com/articles/inside-the-rise-of-bitclout-a-crypto-based-social-network-influencers-andreessen-horowitz-sequoia/#:~:text=Most%20of%20the,about%20BitClout%E2%80%99s%20users\n\nBasically, the top 10 are people who already have very high social status, and who are often impressive but primarily for reasons other than the content they create.\n\nAt the core, Substack is a simple subscription service: you pay http://localhost/search?q=%23N per month, and you get to see the person's articles. But a big part of Substack's success is that they did not just set the mechanism and forget. Their launch process was very hands-on, deliberately seeding the platform with high-quality creators, based on a very particular vision of what kind of high-quality intellectual environment they wanted to foster, including giving selected people revenue guarantees.\n\nSo now, let's get to one idea that I think could work (of course, coming up with new ideas is inherently a more speculative project than criticizing existing ones, and more prone to error).\n\nCreate a DAO, that is *not* token-based. Instead, the inspiration should be Protocol Guild: there are N members, and they can (anonymously) vote new members in and out. If N gets above ~200, consider auto-splitting it.\n\nImportantly, do _not_ try to make the DAO universal or even industry-wide. Instead, embrace the opinionatedness. Be okay with having a dominant type of content (long-form writing, music, short-form video, long-form video, fiction, educational...), and be okay with having a dominant style (eg. country or region of origin, political viewpoint, if within crypto which projects you're most friendly to...). Hand-pick the initial membership set, in order to maximize its alignment with the desired style.\n\nThe goal is to have a group that is larger than one creator and can accumulate a public brand and collectively bargain to seek revenue opportunities, but at the same time small enough that internal governance is tractable.\n\nNow, here is where the tokens come in. In general, one of my hypotheses this decade is that a large portion of effective governance mechanisms will all have the form factor of \"large number of people and bots participating in a prediction market, with the output oracle being a diverse set of people optimized for mission alignment and capture resistance\". In this case, what we do is: anyone can become a creator and create a creator coin, and then, if they get admitted to a creator DAO, a portion of their proceeds from the DAO are used to burn their creator coins.\n\nThis way, the token speculators are NOT participating in a recursive-speculation attention game backed only by itself. Instead, they are specifically being predictors of what new creators the high-value creator DAOs will be willing to accept. At the same time, they also provide a valuable service to the creator DAOs: they are helping surface promising creators for the DAOs to choose from.\n\nSo the ultimate decider of who rises and falls is not speculators, but high-value content creators (we make the assumption that good creators are also good judges of quality, which seems often true). Individual speculators can stay in the game and thrive to the extent that they do a good job of predicting the creator DAOs' actions.",

      "text": "In these five years, the Ethereum Foundation is entering a period of mild austerity, in order to be able to simultaneously meet two goals:\n\n1. Deliver on an aggressive roadmap that ensures Ethereum's status as a performant and scalable world computer that does not compromise on robustness, sustainability and decentralization.\n\n2. Ensures the Ethereum Foundation's own ability to sustain into the long term, and protect Ethereum's core mission and goals, including both the core blockchain layer as well as users' ability to access and use the chain with self-sovereignty, security and privacy.\n\nTo this end, my own share of the austerity is that I am personally taking on responsibilities that might in another time have been \"special projects\" of the EF. Specifically, we are seeking the existence of an open-source, secure and verifiable full stack of software and hardware  that can protect both our personal lives and our public environments ( see https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2025/09/24/openness_and_verifiability.html ). This includes applications such as finance, communication and governance, blockchains, operating systems, secure hardware, biotech (including both personal and public health), and more. If you have seen the Vensa announcement (seeking to make open silicon a commercially viable reality at least for security-critical applications), the https://www.ucritter.com/ including recent versions with built in ZK + FHE + differential-privacy features, the air quality work, my donations to encrypted messaging apps, my own enthusiasm and use for privacy-preserving, walkaway-test-friendly and local-first software (including operating systems), then you know the general spirit of what I am planning to support.\n\nFor this reason I have just withdrawn 16,384 ETH, which will be deployed toward these goals over the next few years. I am also exploring secure decentralized staking options that will allow even more capital from staking rewards to be put toward these goals in the long term.\n\nEthereum itself is an indispensable part of the \"full-stack openness and verifiability\" vision. The Ethereum Foundation will continue with a steadfast focus on developing Ethereum, with that goal in mind. \"Ethereum everywhere\" is nice, but the primary priority is \"Ethereum for people who need it\". Not corposlop, but self-sovereignty, and the baseline infrastructure that enables cooperation without domination.\n\nIn a world where many people's default mindset is that we need to race to become a big strong bully, because otherwise the existing big strong bullies will eat you first, this is the needed alternative. It will involve much more than technology to succeed, but the technical layer is something which is in our control to make happen. The tools to ensure your, and your community's, autonomy and safety, as a basic right that belongs to everyone. Open not in a bullshit \"open means everyone has the right to buy it from us and use our API for $200/month\" way, but actually open, and secure and verifiable so that you know that your technology is working for you.",

      "text": "I'll do the ill-advised thing and try to explain my own thought process and constraints (and possibly unadmitted cowardice) that guide when I do and don't speak on these kinds of political topics - and further down just say what some of my direct opinions are. It's 2026, the careful route isn't getting us anywhere anymore, might as well try being open.\n\nWhen it comes to hot political issues (not abstract questions like tax policy, surveillance, etc, which it's actually easy to talk about, I mean specific events that affect specific groups), I basically have three choices:\n\n1. Talk about none of them\n\n2. Talk about some of them\n\n3. Talk about all of them\n\nMany people do (1). In crypto, many people talk about \"decentralized governance\", a \"freedom\", a \"fairer economy without intermediaries\", \"cypherpunk\", etc etc, and maybe talk about how blockchains and encryption and zero knowledge proofs can make these things happen. But they take care to avoid making the link between those values and any specific situation. This approach is \"safe\". But ultimately, it feels hollow, and I think it makes your mind hollow. It makes it really easy for you to think you're doing the right thing, because you're working on all the right technologies, but then because you never engage on any concrete issue, you don't even notice if you're not actually making any impact on the underlying problems - or worse, actively diverting idealistic talent and effort from actually-effective solutions. I think this applies both to individuals, and to whole communities. And so if you don't want to fall into this trap, you have to engage with the world.\n\nNote that this does not mean that *your work* can't be general-purpose and instead needs to be targeted to directly affect some specific situation in the world. Focused work is good. But I do think the world benefits from a decentralized public apparatus of moral conscience that extends beyond topics that you directly work on.\n\nMany people do (3). But there is a good argument against (3): if you are forced to take positions on everything in the world, then you're usually taking positions on things you had little or no prior understanding of, and your positions are motivated by a few emotional articles or posts that recently convinced you in one direction or the other. And if you have 100 topics, you can only devote 1% of the effort to tracking each one. It becomes easy for someone to convince you of a position that you would not even support if you were more informed about it. There is a reason why people hate the \"omnicause\", \"everything-bagel activists\", etc. Focusing on everything dilutes the message to the point where you're succeeding at nothing (or worse, having actively counterproductive postures on things as a result of low information).\n\nHence, there is the option of (2). But (2) has a natural problem: once you talk about some things, it becomes easier for people to pressure you to talk about even more things, by accusing you of selective outrage and hypocrisy. (And, to be fair, selective outrage and hypocrisy are very real problems) To defend against this, you need to hold \"a line\". One very natural line is to mostly limit your attention to topics that relate to you personally.\n\nFor example, I and my family are from Russia. When I see footage of the war in Ukraine, whether videos of soldiers getting ready for a military operation, or families expressing their anguish after their apartment building or hospital was bombed, they are often speaking in a language I have known since childhood. More importantly, and regrettably, I personally met Vladimir Putin and thus to some small degree helped legitimize him back in 2018. To me, these things mean this conflict relates to me and is my responsibility to do the right thing in (and not just be a passive bystander, perhaps saying \"I am against war\" exactly once and then continuing my life).\n\nSimilarly, Canada is my responsibility, as it's the land where I grew up - both when the government financially deplatformed the truckers (which I criticized), and when the bumbling old man down south starts bullying and threatening its sovereignty (which I've also criticized).\n\nMeanwhile I've spent 0 days in Myanmar or Venezuela, less than three months in the Middle East, and have much less context in those and other places - I know what I know from reading second-hand sources and making my own judgements about which facts are true and false and which arguments are right and wrong, which is far from zero, but it still has limits.\n\nThe United States is a special case, because historically politics in the USA affects the world so much, many people (though today much less than a decade ago) look up to it as an example, and it has massive influence through its economy and its centralized technology platforms. So sorry guys, the entire world has a right to blab about your internal affairs. Something something vaguely similar to \"no taxation without representation\".\n\nThis approach that I outlined does have a weakness: regions of the world that are economically very poor will have very few globally powerful people that have close connections to them. Hence, a \"take care of your own\" norm leaves such people in the dust, vulnerable to being ignored or even outright predated on by others, with no one powerful sticking up for them. I personally try to address this by first making a judgement about whether a faraway situation is more like an internal conflict or more like eg. global public health, and apply the \"take care of your own\" norm in cases like the former and not in cases like the latter.\n\nThis is the explanation I can give for why I've publicly said relatively more about Canada, USA and Russia, and relatively little about Venezuela, Sudan, Africa, Myanmar, China, or the Middle East, including both Iran and the various conflicts involving Israel. Basically, if I don't draw the line roughly here, what other line can I hold?\n\n*Maybe* there are some people who are closer to \"pure devs\" who can hold a different line, speaking *only* about abstract generalities, but I've always covered the full spectrum from pure tech to social issues, so I don't think I *can* hold that line. Hence, instead I have to hold slome further-out and more complicated line.\n\nOf course, it's also easy to construct a less self-serving explanation: I have some view of who my constituency is, and I am a coward who is afraid of offending them. I could respond by pointing to various instances in which I've been publicly brave (whether calling out Craig Wright, or visiting Kyiv, or running through 2km of rain to get to a conference panel on time etc), but maybe my critics can justly counter by pointing out that this is simply the old-as-time masculine tactic of \"compensating for something\".\n\nI will let readers make their own judgements.\n\nNow, my views on a few specific topics:\n\nIran\n\nFrom what I can tell, the Iranian regime is:\n\n* Literally killing tens of thousands of people, in gruesome ways, in its crackdown on the current protests\n\n* Totally denying Iranian people access to the worldwide internet, in part to cover up the above, and there is a high chance that the regime intends this situation to be permanent.\n\n* In the longer term, doing more generally awful things like imposing what clothes women have to wear, providing military support to Russia's invasion, publicly wishing death to various groups on official channels, etc\n\nThese things are unambiguously awful. They're not a \"eh, what can we do\" normal level of awful, they are totally awful. Even if global public condemnation accomplishes nothing else, simply reducing the regime's social status to the point where it equals that of North Korea's gov seems like part of the bare minimum that should be done. Though hopefully, the protests will succeed and expand and Iranian people will get freedom. I hope that the crypto space finds a way to be useful by exploring more options to restore access to the global internet to Iranians.\n\nFurthermore, there is another important point to make: many people say \"this is awful\", but then still maintain an attitude of disapproval toward overly \"impolite\" ways of dealing with the problem, eg. using physical violence against the Iranian leadership. I see the value of a \"suggesting violence is impolite\" norm in maintaining civilization, but IMO that norm should be focused on *initiating* the escalation to full-scale violence; it's fine to respond with violence when violence is already being used in the other direction on a large scale. Being overly pacifist is a good way to feel self-righteous while doing nothing effective to prevent the people you sympathize with from being rolled over.\n\nNothing in those above paragraphs is \"anti-Islamic\". But there is the question: if we analyze the situation, and ask *what causes* the Iranian government to be abnormally brutal, then might the conclusion be that those causes include cultural values that are core to Islam?\n\nI personally don't understand Islam enough to comment. But I can say two things:\n\n* There's plenty of extreme evil that happens without Islam. the invasions carried out by Russia are one good example, there's plenty of extremely dangerous political megalomania worldwide that is 100% secular\n\n* In my experience, the anti-Islam hate that I see in our world often goes beyond cultural criticism, and turns into attacks on people and condemnation of entire ethnic groups (see eg. post 9/11).\n\nCulture can and should be criticized, including by outsiders. This includes banal things, like my view that miles, feet and pounds are stupid units of measurement and SI units are more civilized (I have much less confidence on 'F vs 'C). It also includes deeper things like moral values. But there is a way to do this that does not turn into personal attacks on people. I do often see anti-Islam discourse failing at this (though some criticize effectively and humanely).\n\nIsrael/Gaza\n\nMy moral view on the situation is:\n\n* The attack on Oct 7 was a brutal unjustified war crime that killed around a thousand innocent people, and should be condemned without qualifications\n\n* The response to the attack has killed ~50-100x more people than the original attack, the majority of them civilians, and has destroyed the homes of over a million Gazans and traumatized the entire population. This level of total devastation in response to an attack of a much smaller scale exceeds all reasonable bounds of self-defense, and itself is a brutal war crime\n\n* There are various statements made by high-level officials, actions by soldiers, etc, that I've seen that suggest that the mental state involved in the Gaza operation is less \"a principled effort to protect people\" and more \"classic pre-modern revenge psychology\"\n\n* Hence, the ICC was right to charge both sides of this\n\n* The Israeli government is on the whole a lot more rights-respecting and better to live under than the Hamas one. However, the Hamas government already has social status worse than North Korea. Meanwhile, the Israeli one often gets treated at the highest official levels as a special valued ally, in a way that I fear deeply undermines moral norms, and thus creates room for eg. letting Putin get away with his crimes in Ukraine. This is an imbalance, and I think this is something that many people are reacting against.\n\n* What happened in 1967, 1948, and arguably even the late 2000s is honestly not very relevant to this moral analysis. The majority of the population was not even alive when those things happened, there's no good moral reason why the fate of a 14 year old kid who is seeing their home or family destroyed should depend on arcane debates about the previous century's history\n\n* The biggest heroes in this situation are probably people quietly working in the background to reconnect people and lay the ground for peace that will hopefully shape itself over decades. I don't think the world can respond *only* by doing this, because it's also important to defend norms (\"injustice anywhere is a threat to justice anywhere\"), but I'm really glad these people exist and morally support them.\n\nI strongly oppose anti-Semitism. To me, this is a special case of the broader moral principle that one should not judge entire ethnic groups by the decisions of a few elites. In other worlds, \"hate the government, not the people\". One important corollary of this, of course, is that criticizing the Israeli government does not count as anti-Semitism.\n\nPrinciples vs details of the situation\n\nI should note explicitly that these moral views above are very \"principles-driven\" and not \"details of the situation\" driven. I think this is the correct level at which to approach this. The reason is that while \"details of the situation\" thinking often can acknowledge subtle important facts that would otherwise be ignored, nevertheless:\n\n* It has very low galaxy brain resistance ( https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2025/11/07/galaxybrain.html ). It's too easy to cherry-pick details that favor your side, and appeal to particularism (\"you outsiders can't understand...\") to shield one's local bullying from external pushback\n\n* It's not something you can build norms around. Peace and humanitarianism in the world depend on moral norms: the fact that the whole world recoils in disgust at certain unconscionable outcomes, and that it can do this in lockstep, and can't be divided-and-conquered by arguing arcane points about third-order game theory or history. Some say \"norms are fake anyway, we're in the law of the jungle, you have to protect your own\". To anyone who sincerely believes this, all I can say is: YOU HAVE NO FRIGGIN IDEA HOW MUCH EVERYONE, EVEN THE VILLAINS, ARE HOLDING THEMSELVES BACK BECAUSE OF MORALITY AND NORMS EVEN TODAY, AND HENCE, HOW MUCH WORSE THINGS COULD GET\n\n* Outsiders to a situation have more understanding of principles than of situational details. Hence, if it's valid for outsiders to express views on things at all, they should focus on their relative expertise, which is the principles.\n\nICE and Immigration\n\nThe other big thing happening now, that I've been silent on, is ICE turning into a full-on police state and now shooting protesters in broad daylight.\n\nThe immigration issue is complex and it is important to separate two aspects:\n\n* Whether less or more immigration is good (and what kinds). If the highest acceptable level of immigration is less than the level that would naturally arise in the absence of either walls or deportation, then walls or deportation are in principle required.\n\n* The fact that ICE is acting like total assholes about this situation.\n\nThese things can and must be separated. There are immigration systems far more restrictive than USA, whose implementation is more humane.\n\nThe second needs to be strongly opposed, full stop, no counterarguments admitted. Once the police state apparatus exists to this extent, it *will* keep finding new targets. Even today, it has already expanded its violence from illegal immigrants to obviously-American defenders of immigrants. [insert Niemöller poem here]\n\nToday, this second issue (the cruelty) is the more important one in the USA, and its morality is pretty cut-and-dried simple, as described above, so nothing more to say about it. So now, on to the first issue (ideal levels of immigration).\n\nI am generally persuaded by Bryan Caplan-style arguments that the answer is \"very high\". To summarize:\n\n(i) the bulk of economic evidence suggests that high-skilled immigration is pretty close to no-downsides good, high-volume low-skilled immigration *slightly* depresses wages of low-wage locals, but it also means consumer prices go down for everyone. The $3 falafels in Berlin (which in turn support the city's status as an affordable home for various artistic and cultural activities) are only possible because of the Middle Eastern low-skill labor\n\n(ii) in the USA, even illegal immigrants (!!!) on average commit less crime than the native population. In Europe though this is not true.\n\nI also add my own bespoke point (iii): if you are worried about change to *culture*, then I believe that the larger driver of culture change is not foreigners but technology. The real great replacement is the kids growing up on TikTok. (also, much of cross-country culture spread happens through the internet, not via farm workers or Uber drivers)\n\nAnd so actually I believe that if you care about stopping the great replacement, the right thing to invest in is ... longevity technology, so that existing human beings and their generations with unique cultures can survive through the ages as human beings, and not just as history pages. That's right: making everyone live 10x longer is a *conservative* technology.\n\n(To the counterargument that this will also make evil dictators live 10x longer and prevent their societies from ever escaping: if we get into that world and a dictator gets too awful, then yeah I'm ok with droning them, I already said so above)\n\nHowever, the downsides to public safety and government welfare expenditure from some types of immigrants are real. Personally, I think that we're very far from exhausting the opportunities we have to solve this problem without deporting people at all - I regularly see stories of criminals getting freed after committing three murders and then quickly going out and committing a fourth. We should stop doing this. Every act of lenience against a violent criminal saps public acceptance for immigration, and thus leads to ten acts of anti-lenience toward peaceful foreigners. Hence, true long-term empathy would withhold lenience from the criminals, and apply that lenience to peaceful foreigners instead.\n\nBut there is a larger problem behind this problem. Western morality is very dominated by \"out of sight out of mind\" bias. If you are on the inside of the wall, then you're part of the family, all human beings are equal, let's sing and dance in a circle. If you are on the outside of the wall, then you get performative thoughts and prayers, but in terms of substantive support, well, hang on we'll get right back to you.\n\nThis is where I think the social role of the \"illegal immigrant\" category in the USA comes in. It is a strange category, because we're saying that legally there are tens of millions of people who are violating the law on a mass scale, but we're not _doing_ that much about it. Requiring employers to verify immigration status of employees frequently gets shot down. But from the perspective of \"Western society hacking around its own broken moral code\", it makes perfect sense. We believe in \"all humans are equal\", that \"second-class citizenship\" is a bad and dystopian idea, that everyone deserves \"good\" working conditions, etc etc.  But the economic reality is that the wage level that maximizes (not only local economic, but also humanitarian) gains from hiring foreign labor is lower than the level that is acceptable to locals - if you force the wage for low-skill foreigners up to the same level as locals, then you end up hiring much fewer of them, and so even the total humanitarian benefit you bring to low-income foreigners by giving them more economic opportunity is lower. So how do we solve this? Well, we invent the \"illegal immigrant\" category, and so the moral baseline becomes \"well technically you don't even have the right to be here, and so really, anything you get here counts as an extra bonus\". This is the moral self-arbitrage.\n\nThe problem is that wealthy countries by default are exactly in the position of the space colony from the movie Elysium: they're gated communities for the global rich, where everyone outside is a second-class citizen on a global scale. So if we say \"we refuse to exploit foreign labor, they can all stay outside\", we're not actually being moral.\n\nHence, to me the principled solution seems to be, to be more willing as a society to say \"you're welcome in the land and you can work, but you're not part of the family\", and to create visa categories that reflect this fact. Paths to become part of the family should continue to exist, but it's okay for those paths to be much more difficult than paths to simply come in and work. This is a model that already works well in many places in the non-West. And today, I find many non-Western countries increasingly opening themselves up to foreigners, while Western countries close down, add more ESTA and visa bureaucracy, border guards become more annoying and insufferable, etc.\n\nThe grand sacrifice: take less seriously the idea that \"once you're within the walls, everyone is part of the family and is equal\". This mentality was more sustainable in the 20th century, when people's identities were mostly bound up with a single country and most people did not even see anything outside their home country, but it is incompatible with the 21st, where information is global and our identities are plural. Unless we can achieve equality across the whole world, saying \"within our home we are equal, outside our home go away\" is ultimately a larp morality, and we should move on to something better. This *should* be a major task of the next generation of compassion-driven political philosophers. If we do this, it opens the door to greater openness to the outside world, which will ultimately be a human rights boon to everyone by giving people much-needed second options.\n\n(special thanks to http://localhost/ameensol for pushing me to be more brave even though I predict he will disagree with ~1/3 of the above)",

If an availability guarantee on data is required, then that guarantee is required, no way around it. But you _can_ split it up and erasure code it, a la PeerDAS. You can do graceful degradation for it: if a node only has 1/10 the data capacity of the other nodes, it can always produce blocks 1/10 the size.\n\nState is the hardest. To guarantee the ability to verify even one transaction, you need the full state. If you replace the state with a tree and keep the root, you need the full state to be able to update that root.

      "text": "I no longer agree with this previous tweet of mine - since 2017, I have become a much more willing connoisseur of mountains. It's worth explaining why.\n\nhttps://nitter.net/VitalikButerin/status/873177382164848641\n\nFirst, the original context. That tweet was in a debate with Ian Grigg, who argued that blockchains should track the order of transactions, but not the state (eg. user balances, smart contract code and storage):\n\n> The messages are logged, but the state (e.g., UTXO) is implied, which means it is constructed by the computer internally, and then (can be) thrown away.\n\nI was heavily against this philosophy, because it would imply that users have no way to get the state other than either (i) running a node that processed every transaction in all of history, or (ii) trusting someone else.\n\nIn blockchains that commit to the state in the block header (like Ethereum), you can simply prove any value in the state with a Merkle branch. This is conditional on the honest majority assumption: if >= 50% of the consensus participants are honest, then the chain with the most PoW (or PoS) support will be valid, and so the state root will be correct.\n\nTrusting an honest majority is far better than trusting a single RPC provider. Not trusting at all (by personally verifying every transaction in the chain) is theoretically ideal, but it's a computation load infeasible for regular users, unless we take the (even worse) tradeoff of keeping blockchain capacity so low that most people cannot even use the chain.\n\nNow, what has changed since then?\n\nThe biggest thing is of course ZK-SNARKs. We now have a technology that lets you verify the correctness of the chain, without literally re-executing every transaction. WE INVENTED THE THING THAT GETS YOU THE BENEFITS WITHOUT THE COSTS! This is like if someone from the future teleported back into US healthcare debates in 2008, and demonstrated a clearly working pill that anyone could make for $15 that cured all diseases. Like, yes, if we have that pill, we should get the government fully out of healthcare, let people make the pill and sell it at Walgreens, and healthcare becomes super affordable so everyone is happy. ZK-SNARKs are literally like that but for the block size war. (With two asterisks for block building centralization and data bandwidth, but that's a separate topic)\n\nWith better technology, we should raise our expectations, and revisit tradeoffs that we made grudgingly in a previous era.\n\nBut also, I have actually changed my mind on some of the underlying issues. In 2017, I was thinking about blockchains in terms of academic assumptions - what is okay to rely on honest majority for, when we are ok with 1-of-N trust assumption, etc. If a construction gave better properties under known-acceptable assumptions, I would eagerly embrace it.\n\nOn a raw subconscious level, I don't think I was sufficiently appreciative of the fact that _in the real world, lots of things break_. Sometimes the p2p network goes down. Sometimes the p2p network has 20x the latency you expected - anyone who has played WoW can attest to long spans of time when the latency spiked up from its usual ~200ms to 1000-5000ms. Sometimes a third party service you've been relying on for years shuts down, and there isn't a good alternative. If the alternative is that you personally go through a github repo and figure out how to PERSONALLY RUN A SERVER, lots of people will give up and never figure it out and end up permanently losing access to their money. Sometimes mining or staking gets concentrated to the point where 51% attacks are very easy to imagine, and you almost have to game-theoretically analyze consensus security as though 75% of miners or stakers are controlled by one single agent. Sometimes, as we saw with tornado cash, intermediaries all start censoring some application, and your *only* option becomes to directly use the chain.\n\nIf we are making a self-sovereign blockchain to last through the ages, THE ANSWER TO THE ABOVE CONUNDRUMS CANNOT ALWAYS BE \"CALL THE DEVS\". If it is, the devs themselves become the point of centralization - they become DEVS in the ancient Roman sense, where the letter V was used to represent the U sound.\n\nThe Mountain Man's cabin is not meant as the replacement lifestyle for everyone. It is meant as the safe place to retreat to when things go wrong. It is also meant as the universal BATNA (\"Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement\") - the alternative option that improves your well-being not just in the case when you end up needing it, but also because knowledge of it existing motivates third parties to give you better terms. This is like how Bittorrent existing is an important check on the power of music and video streaming platforms, driving them to offer customers better terms.\n\nWe do not need to start living every day in the Mountain Man's cabin. But part of maintaining the infinite garden of Ethereum is certainly keeping the cabin well-maintained.\n\nvitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin)\n\nThe idea of average users personally validating the entire history of the system is a weird mountain man fantasy.

      "text": "Mefai look from a different perspective. We will document everything that transpired on Binance last night, so that it may serve as a lesson for the future.\n\nBinance, as the world's largest exchange, became the epicenter of this wave of selling and the atmosphere of panic. http://localhost/search?q=%23Binance was not the initiator of this event, but rather the main stage where it unfolded. The exchange's infrastructure was confronted with one of the greatest selling pressures in history.\n\nOur intention here isn't to praise http://localhost/cz_binance  or http://localhost/Binance.  However, as a financial AI, we have an obligation to share evidence-backed results without any commentary. These are the results of extensive records and detailed on-chain analysis.\n\nThe summary of last night was this: sales that they couldn't execute on their own boards were sent by Coinbase and other exchanges to a single exchange through a market maker, and they wanted to throw everything that happened onto the battlefield. Not at the combatants. Now, let's begin in order. +++",
